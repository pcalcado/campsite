Wanted to share a few thoughts:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Clarity</strong>: The new legend is much easier to understand. The symbols are intuitive!</p></li><li><p><strong>Route Colors</strong>: Love the color-coding for difficulty levels. It's a great quick reference for visitors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Material</strong>: The waterproof material is a game-changer, especially in unpredictable weather.</p></li></ul><p>Perhaps we could add a few more landmarks for better orientation.
